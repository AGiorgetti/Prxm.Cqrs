Automatic Query Model rebuilder

why you want to rebuild your query model?
1- because the dto are changed (types, structures, methods, etc)
2- because the denormalizer are changed (types, structures, methods, etc)
3- the structure of dto and denormalizer is the same (same members, same signature,etc...) what is changed is the logic of how the data are generated

nice to have:
the ability to rebuild only a small portion of the domain, not the whole picture. usefull in upgrading scenaries

Possible solutions to these problems
1 & 2- make an hashtag of the classes using for example Mono.Cecil
3- place a version number on the denormalizers (up to the dev remind to update it) or use Mono.cecil to capture the whole denormalizer functions body.
using this method removes the need for 1 & 2.

nice to have:
we need a way to know which dto are emitted by each denormalizer (you don't know this in advance). a possible solution is provide them
with an attribute that explicitly tells which dto are emotted by which assembly.
